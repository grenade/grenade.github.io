      "With RWE Supply & Trading, I managed release & deployments across the Risk development teams. My responsibilities included continuous integration advocacy & implementation & as part of this remit I championed technologies & tools that contribute to effective working practices.I administered the DVCS (Git - Atlassian Stash, Crucible, FishEye) & CI (TeamCity) servers & provided the integrations to Atlassian Jira & Confluence. I developed applications & scripts that assist with the CI process including database snapshotting, promotion & migration strategies & I administer a number of Oracle Exadata servers. I also set up & administer several NuGet & Nexus artefact repositories. I contributed to the Global Risk development effort with peer code reviews, database, C# & ASP.Net development. Working with a senior project team, we delivered the business' first globally consolidated, Risk reporting platform, bringing integrated, centralised views of risk indicators which give analysts up-to-date reports at multiple granular & aggregation levels."
