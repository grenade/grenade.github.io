    "brief": [
      "In Reading with Visa Europe, I worked on geo-tagged, location based, fraud profiling & completed several R&D spearhead projects for reporting & live monitoring of mission critical, high volume, key transaction & authorisation systems. Our software used ARC GIS & Dundas Maps to accurately map fraud in near-real-time & report visual fraud location data. My team led the .Net development program making use of cutting edge Microsoft technologies including C# 3.5/4.0, MEF, WPF, Silverlight, ASP.Net MVC, WCF, VS 2010, TFS 2010 & SQL Server 2008. My role included promotion of best of breed practices in scalable enterprise architecture, implementation of Agile methodology, continuous integration with MS Build & Team System as well as providing guidance & demonstration in the use of new C# 4.0/3.5 language constructs & syntax to support interfacing with AbInitio & other financial transaction management systems."
