An MS Word version for placement agencies is available <a href="data/cv/rob-thijssen-cv.doc"> <img src="images/ms-word.svg" style="width: 16px; height: 16px; border: 0"> here </a>. </p> <p>For those of you who prefer the <em>tl;dr</em>, a summary follows:</p> <p> <em> I am an educated software developer and continuous integration specialist, working in the enterprise Microsoft (.Net/MSSql), Linux (Java/Oracle) and agnostic (Mongo/Elastic/Angular/Node) arenas. </em> </p> <p> <em> I have a history of doing contract based, project work, for big, recognisable, organisations in the UK, Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, India and Costa Rica (my favourite). I am generally appreciated for the work I do, which is honest, valuable and efficient. I am on good terms with most previous employers and am often invited to participate in further work. </em> </p> <p> <em> I prefer to work with forward thinking organisations who embrace some of the best technology available. It is my experience that development teams using Git for source control, mostly have their house in order with the rest of the tech stack. I am happy to work with teams who aspire to utilise better technologies. I will also work with teams who do not embrace these ideas, if the money or location is exceptional or if the assignment is brief and focused. </em> </p> <p> <em> I have big hair, ride a very fast motorcycle and enjoy friendship, good food and red wine, which makes me a big smiler and fun to have around. </em> </p> </div>
