We were working within tight deadlines to provide a solution that tied a number of NHS &amp; commercial enterprise solutions together. We developed within an Agile/Scrum environment with participation from Conchango, Boots, IBM &amp; Microsoft. The project was interesting &amp; unique in that it was one of the first in the UK to implement the .Net 2 framework at its level of complexity with an SQL 2005/ADO.Net back-end. This was a highly skilled team made up entirely of senior developers who are leaders in their respective fields.

I also made extensive use of the ITextSharp libraries to dynamically generate complex PDF documentation. We also made extensive use of Trac &amp; Subversion for Source Control.

            <p>As an Agile development team we developed in fortnightly iterations which allowed us to focus our efforts on priority business requirements &amp; respond quickly to change &amp; implementation requests. I was responsible for the migration of C++ &amp; VB.Net code to C#. This involved a great deal of refactoring &amp; because we ran a Test Driven environment I wrote a great deal of NUnit test code in C# to ensure that the migration &amp; refactoring resulted in stable, bug free code that met requirements. We also formalised our enterprise integration patterns through the use of a Pipes &amp; Filters approach to message handling.</p>

        <p>Perhaps less interesting is my involvement with Open-Source projects &amp; programming for the sake of it within Linux community based projects. I am a regular contributor to Open Source Software because I believe that elegant, efficient, secure code can only be achieved &amp; proven through transparent scrutiny &amp; because I have learned a great deal from scrutiny of the work of others in the OS community.</p>
        <p>I also enjoyed a year in Kenya working with the Red Cross &amp; UNICEF providing food &amp; medical aid to children affected by poverty. I was based in Nairobi &amp; involved with distribution of aid. I also spent six months prior to this involved with fund-raising efforts in Ireland &amp; the UK. My job entailed soliciting contributions from businesses &amp; corporations &amp; was overall a very rewarding experience.</p>
