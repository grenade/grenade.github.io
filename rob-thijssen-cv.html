            <p>This position, for one of the UK’s leading Agile software development companies was based in Nottingham, developing C# applications on the .Net 2 framework within Team System. Our focus was on delivery of mission critical enterprise applications centred on dispensing of drugs &amp; other pharmaceuticals for Boots PLC. We were working within tight deadlines to provide a solution that tied a number of NHS &amp; commercial enterprise solutions together. We developed within an Agile/Scrum environment with participation from Conchango, Boots, IBM &amp; Microsoft. The project was interesting &amp; unique in that it was one of the first in the UK to implement the .Net 2 framework at its level of complexity with an SQL 2005/ADO.Net back-end. This was a highly skilled team made up entirely of senior developers who are leaders in their respective fields.

Our principle technologies were ASP.Net &amp; C# on the .Net 1.1 Framework &amp; one of my more interesting projects involved porting the existing Continuity code-base to run on the Linux &amp; Mac Mono .Net framework. I also made extensive use of the ITextSharp libraries to dynamically generate complex PDF documentation. We also made extensive use of Trac &amp; Subversion for Source Control. As Continuity delivers pure XML content, much of my work entailed development of the XSL transformations to XHTML.</p>

            <p>As an Agile development team we developed in fortnightly iterations which allowed us to focus our efforts on priority business requirements &amp; respond quickly to change &amp; implementation requests. I was responsible for the migration of C++ &amp; VB.Net code to C#. This involved a great deal of refactoring &amp; because we ran a Test Driven environment I wrote a great deal of NUnit test code in C# to ensure that the migration &amp; refactoring resulted in stable, bug free code that met requirements. We also formalised our enterprise integration patterns through the use of a Pipes &amp; Filters approach to message handling.</p>

The project encompassed the integration of Business Objects, Crystal Reports &amp; bespoke PHP4, PHP5 &amp; Perl web applications with an AS400 DB2 ODBC back-end. I was the lead developer &amp; managed a small team of IT personnel. I had responsibility for the technical architecture &amp; design of a number of business applications focussed around ERP. The role involved a significant use of complex SQL, VB6, Object Oriented PHP &amp; C++. As a manufacturing company we worked to customer &amp; business requirements which required a great deal of flexibility &amp; a ‘roll up your sleeves’ approach to problem solving &amp; customer satisfaction.</p>

            <h5>June 2004 - October 2004</h5>
            <p>Working on Devon's Local Government e-Enablement project, I was responsible for the design, development &amp; maintenance of the reporting infrastructure using Crystal Reports &amp; Oracle data-sources. I maintained &amp; administered the associated Business Objects servers. Much of the work involved data analysis, writing complex SQL queries &amp; providing advice to staff &amp; contractors on the use of Crystal Reports, writing SQL queries &amp; procedures &amp; the use of client tools including PLSQL.</p>

            <h5>September 2002 - June 2004</h5>
            <p>Initially I was the sole developer for this Start-Up mobile solutions provider. As the company progressed &amp; grew I undertook responsibility for a team of developers. I managed &amp; contributed to the development of bespoke OO PHP applications for delivery of mobile services &amp; the internal management through reports &amp; statistical analysis. I managed the migration of our data services from MySQL to Oracle RDBMS. As a customer-facing &amp; results-oriented business, Agile methodology &amp; principles was our natural development environment.</p>

            <h4>BSc (Hons) Computer Systems &amp; Networks, University of Plymouth, United Kingdom</h4>
            <p>Completed my studies with honours &amp; received an Upper Second Class degree (2:1). It was a four year sandwich course which meant that I took a year out to complete a relevant industrial placement. The course included a strong programming element in C &amp; C++. My final year project &amp; dissertation was centred on Web Service technologies &amp; their use in the commercial dissemination of information across the World Wide Web.</p>

        <h2><a name="Interests" class="anchor" href="#Interests"></a>Interests &amp; Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I enjoy <a href="http://mcmiles.net/">motorcycle road trips</a>, <a href="http://magnifik.org">old sailboats &amp; yachts</a>, mountain biking &amp; snowboarding when time permits &amp; am a 4x4, over-landing enthusiast with particular interest in LandCruisers, especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Land_Cruiser_(J40)">really old ones</a>.</p>
        <p>Perhaps less interesting is my involvement with Open-Source projects &amp; programming for the sake of it within Linux community based projects. I am a regular contributor to Open Source Software because I believe that elegant, efficient, secure code can only be achieved &amp; proven through transparent scrutiny &amp; because I have learned a great deal from scrutiny of the work of others in the OS community.</p>
        <p>I also enjoyed a year in Kenya working with the Red Cross &amp; UNICEF providing food &amp; medical aid to children affected by poverty. I was based in Nairobi &amp; involved with distribution of aid. I also spent six months prior to this involved with fund-raising efforts in Ireland &amp; the UK. My job entailed soliciting contributions from businesses &amp; corporations &amp; was overall a very rewarding experience.</p>
