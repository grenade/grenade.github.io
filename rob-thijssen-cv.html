            <h5>August 2006 – December 2006</h5>
            <p>I designed and implemented an advanced tuberculosis surveillance and reporting solution at the Centre for Infections. The application monitors disease outbreaks and patient care throughout the United Kingdom. My remit included the system design and architecture as well as developing the infrastructure for builds, releases and testing. I was also involved with negotiations with customers and users around both technical and user requirements as well as analysis and project planning. We delivered reporting software depicting geographical analysis of disease trends utilising GIS and mapping controls. The solution architecture was centred on SQL Server 2005 with dynamic SQL Reporting Services, .Net 2.0 (C#), MS Build, Atlas (Ajax), Web Services and took advantage of the rad / telerik libraries. The user interface contained many web 2.0 features while the middle tier was supported by a WSE solution that provided interfaces to the various regional authority databases and reporting systems using ADO.Net to connect to its own SQL Server data-store. I was involved with implementing patterns and practices for other projects and promoting Agile methodologies within the development departments.</p>

            <h4>Conchango, Lead Developer</h4>
            <h5>October 2005 – February 2006</h5>
            <p>This position, for one of the UK’s leading Agile software development companies was based in Nottingham, developing C# applications on the .Net 2 framework within Team System. Our focus was on delivery of mission critical enterprise applications centred on dispensing of drugs and other pharmaceuticals for Boots PLC. We were working within tight deadlines to provide a solution that tied a number of NHS and commercial enterprise solutions together. We developed within an Agile/Scrum environment with participation from Conchango, Boots, IBM and Microsoft. The project was interesting and unique in that it was one of the first in the UK to implement the .Net 2 framework at its level of complexity with an SQL 2005/ADO.Net back-end. This was a highly skilled team made up entirely of senior developers who are leaders in their respective fields. Strong focus was placed on thorough implementation of best practices and continuous integration using Agile, Continuous Integration and Team System.</p>

          <li>
            <h4>M-Corp, Senior Developer</h4>
            <h5>August 2005 – October 2005</h5>
            <p>This contract position was for a prestigious .Net development house in Hampshire. I worked with the company's Continuity application framework and content management system. My responsibilities included creating bespoke software solutions for clients like Motorola, Dean &amp; Dyball and the RNLI. Our principle technologies were ASP.Net and C# on the .Net 1.1 Framework and one of my more interesting projects involved porting the existing Continuity code-base to run on the Linux and Mac Mono .Net framework. I also made extensive use of the ITextSharp libraries to dynamically generate complex PDF documentation. We also made extensive use of Trac and Subversion for Source Control. As Continuity delivers pure XML content, much of my work entailed development of the XSL transformations to XHTML.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>British Telecom, BT Exact, Senior Developer</h4>
            <h5>June 2005 – August 2005</h5>
            <p>My position at BT was a contract developing for the 'FastPeter' project. I developed and supported transaction based messaging applications in C#. My team’s focus was on the enabling of simultaneous provision of PSTN and ADSL for UK customers. We facilitated the provision of broadband to BT customers as well as our wholesale client’s customers and those on the unbundled exchanges (basically, all broadband in the UK). We employed Continuous Integration, Test Driven Development and Agile Methodologies in an Extreme Programming environment utilising MS Build, Nant, NUnit and Version One.</p>
            <p>As an Agile development team we developed in fortnightly iterations which allowed us to focus our efforts on priority business requirements and respond quickly to change and implementation requests. I was responsible for the migration of C++ and VB.Net code to C#. This involved a great deal of refactoring and because we ran a Test Driven environment I wrote a great deal of NUnit test code in C# to ensure that the migration and refactoring resulted in stable, bug free code that met requirements. We also formalised our enterprise integration patterns through the use of a Pipes and Filters approach to message handling.</p>
          </li>

            <h4>Centrax Ltd., Turbine Components, Business Process Manager</h4>
            <h5>October 2004 – April 2005</h5>
            <p>My focus at Centrax was on the development of the stock requirements, forecasting and management system. The project encompassed the integration of Business Objects, Crystal Reports and bespoke PHP4, PHP5 and Perl web applications with an AS400 DB2 ODBC back-end. I was the lead developer and managed a small team of IT personnel. I had responsibility for the technical architecture and design of a number of business applications focussed around ERP. The role involved a significant use of complex SQL, VB6, Object Oriented PHP and C++. As a manufacturing company we worked to customer and business requirements which required a great deal of flexibility and a ‘roll up your sleeves’ approach to problem solving and customer satisfaction.</p>

            <h4>Devon County Council, Senior Developer</h4>
            <h5>June 2004 – October 2004</h5>
            <p>Working on Devon's Local Government e-Enablement project, I was responsible for the design, development and maintenance of the reporting infrastructure using Crystal Reports and Oracle data-sources. I maintained and administered the associated Business Objects servers. Much of the work involved data analysis, writing complex SQL queries and providing advice to staff and contractors on the use of Crystal Reports, writing SQL queries and procedures and the use of client tools including PLSQL.</p>
          </li>

            <h4>TxtNation (mSolutions) LLP., Chief Technical Architect</h4>
            <h5>September 2002 – June 2004</h5>
            <p>Initially I was the sole developer for this Start-Up mobile solutions provider. As the company progressed and grew I undertook responsibility for a team of developers. I managed and contributed to the development of bespoke OO PHP applications for delivery of mobile services and the internal management through reports and statistical analysis. I managed the migration of our data services from MySQL to Oracle RDBMS. As a customer-facing and results-oriented business, Agile methodology and principles was our natural development environment.</p>

            <p>Completed my studies with honours and received an Upper Second Class degree (2:1). It was a four year sandwich course which meant that I took a year out to complete a relevant industrial placement. The course included a strong programming element in C and C++. My final year project and dissertation was centred on Web Service technologies and their use in the commercial dissemination of information across the World Wide Web.</p>

        <p>I enjoy <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/photos/100557451161674433638/albums/5919455836733926625">motorcycle road trips</a>, <a href="http://magnifik.org">old sailboats and yachts</a>, mountain biking and snowboarding when time permits and am a 4x4, over-landing enthusiast with particular interest in LandCruisers, especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Land_Cruiser_(J40)">really old ones</a>.</p>
        <p>Perhaps less interesting is my involvement with Open-Source projects and programming for the sake of it within Linux community based projects. I am a regular contributor to Open Source Software because I believe that elegant, efficient, secure code can only be achieved and proven through transparent scrutiny and because I have learned a great deal from scrutiny of the work of others in the OS community.</p>
        <p>I also enjoyed a year in Kenya working with the Red Cross and UNICEF providing food and medical aid to children affected by poverty. I was based in Nairobi and involved with distribution of aid. I also spent six months prior to this involved with fund-raising efforts in Ireland and the UK. My job entailed soliciting contributions from businesses and corporations and was overall a very rewarding experience.</p>
