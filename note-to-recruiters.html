        <h2>Awesome recruiter,</h2>
        <p>You guys rock! I respect you &amp; I appreciate what you do. Almost all of my work for the last 12 years has come through you &amp; your industry colleagues. Thank you! You put the bread on my family's table. We are very grateful.</p>
        <img src="images/BreadOnTheTable.jpg" alt="Fresh bread on a table." class="shadow center mb" />
        <p>Most of the recruiters and agents I have dealt with are great people who know their jobs and the IT industry well. The ones I respect also have a great understanding of the current players.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>They know our clients. They know our clients values as well as their concerns.</li>
          <li>They know the contractors. They can recruit from a pool of people they know directly or who are known by people they know directly. Sometimes they go outside the pool, but because they know how to read a CV properly and filter out bullshit, they find people worth adding to their pool.</li>
          <li>They know the market. They know what a skillset is worth and what the market can bear to pay at any given time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That is to their credit. It shows they take their work seriously and they pride themselves on matching good candidates with the right client.</p>
        <img src="images/SaveTime.jpg" alt="Boy putting clocks in a piggy bank." class="shadow center mb" />
        <h2>Lets save each other some time:</h2>
        <p>Before you decide whether or not, we should have a chat about a contract opportunity, let me tell you a little about myself.</p>
        <p>I live in Plymouth. Yes, the one down in deepest darkest Devon. I'm not about to move. I love Devon.</p>
        <p>There's no attractive work in Plymouth (from a remuneration perspective). At least in my niche, so I commute weekly or fortnightly. I've been doing this for more than ten years &amp; I am solidly reliable about turning up before 9 on a Monday morning regardless of whether the office is in Kiev or Rio (I exagerate, I've never been to Rio, please send me there). There probably isn't any place your clients can conjure that I won't go as long as the remuneration is right. If you can prove me wrong and find me attractive work within commute distance of my home, I will pull out all the stops and take you out to the best dinner we can find. That's a promise and a dare.</p>
        <p>In my tiny, particular niche in the DevOps/continuous integration/environment management space, I am a subject matter expert and an authority. I am very comfortable saying that there are no problems in this arena, that I am uncomfortable owning and solving. Because of this, I have become accustomed to earning slightly better &amp; sometimes, much better, than market rates. If you are recruiting in this space, you will already know how that translates into sterling. There is probably no point in us speaking, if your client wants the cheapest resource around. I would hope, in that case, you would already have eliminated my profile from shortlisting.</p>
        <p>There are exceptions to my remuneration expectations. I will work for considerably less if your client can put me in any of the following situations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Send me somewhere exotic and warm. Think Bali or Tahiti, not the Sahara.</li>
          <li>Send me to a tax free jurisdiction. I enjoy paying tax as much as you do.</li>
          <li>Send me to outer space or the bottom of the sea or Antartica or somewhere just as remarkable.</li>
          <li>Put me to work on a humanitarian cause. I'm always on the lookout for work that provides a sense of accomplishment towards the greater good rather than just increasing the shareholder bottom-line.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="images/RocketShip.jpg" alt="A rocket ship" class="shadow center mb" />
        <p>If you want me to work for another bank/insurance/energy company, then read Tom &amp; Jerry's lips below. It's not that I don't like working for those guys, I really do. I just like taking their money more.</p>
        <img src="images/ShowMeTheMoney.jpg" alt="Jerry Maguire, shouting 'show me the money!' into the phone" class="shadow center mb" />
        <p>Following is a recent recruitment call transcript. If you are a recruiter, it might give you an idea of the kind of conversation that it will be unproductive for us to have. This is close but isn't word for word. It's just my notes after the call was closed. In the recruiters defence, she was hiring for a perm role, whereas, I generally only do contracts. I had expressed an interest via email after being approached on LinkedIn because she represents a company that looks outstanding on paper (&amp; probably is). I had hoped that I had finally found an opportunity right in my neighborhood. But somehow we had a little difficulty communicating. Bear in mind that this recruiter approached me after reading my CV and this site (minus this paragraph and transcript of course).</p>
        <ul class="transcript">
          <li class="rc">Hi, I contacted you on LinkedIn yesterday. Is it a good time to talk?</li>
          <li class="me">Sure.</li>
          <li class="rc">Have you had a chance to look at our website and see what we do?</li>
          <li class="me">Yes. I responded to you, because the prospect of working in the South West is appealing.</li>
          <li class="rc">First of all could you explain to me why you are interested in working with us?</li>
          <li class="me">I was trying to convey that I'm interested in working in Exeter because I live in Plymouth and normally have to commute quite far to get to work.</li>
          <li class="rc">How far?</li>
          <li class="me">London, Bangalore, Copenhagen, Essen, Fribourg in recent years.</li>
          <li class="rc">So would you relocate if you were to come and work with us?</li>
          <li class="me">No. Exeter is an easy commute from Plymouth.</li>
          <li class="rc">So can you explain why you want to work with us?</li>
          <li class="me">Mostly because I like the location and the prospect of an easy commute.</li>
          <li class="rc">Oh, I see. Can you tell me what sort of work you are looking for?</li>
          <li class="me">Well, any sort of work that involves an easy commute, really.</li>
          <li class="rc">Ok. Can you explain what sort of work you have been doing?</li>
          <li class="me">Sure! I am a DevOps guy with a programming background... yada yada yada...</li>
          <li class="rc">Great! I have two roles that might interest you. We're a cloud based company and one of our roles involves managing our Amazon Web Services strategy. Do you have any experience with AWS?</li>
          <li class="me">Well, yes actually.</li>
          <li class="rc">Could you give me some background?</li>
          <li class="me">Certainly. But before we delve into this, lets talk money. One of the reasons I've had to travel so much for work is that most jobs in the South West don't meet my salary expectations.</li>
          <li class="rc">What are your salary expectations?</li>
          <li class="me">(half my normal rate).</li>
          <li class="rc">We haven't got that.</li>
          <li class="me">Ok. Its probably not worth me explaining about my AWS experience then.</li>
          <li class="rc">Well, how flexible can you be on salary?</li>
          <li class="me">Not very.</li>
          <li class="rc">How about (quarter my normal rate)?</li>
          <li class="me">No.</li>
          <li class="rc">I'll put your CV on file and call you if... yada yada...</li>
          <li class="me">k, thx, bye...</li>
          <li class="rc">... yada yada...</li>
          <li class="me">...click...beep...</li>
