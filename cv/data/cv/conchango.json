    "brief": [
      "This position, for one of the UKâ€™s leading Agile software development companies was based in Nottingham, developing C# applications on the .Net 2 framework within Team System. Our focus was on delivery of mission critical enterprise applications centred on dispensing of drugs & other pharmaceuticals for Boots PLC. We were working within tight deadlines to provide a solution that tied a number of NHS & commercial enterprise solutions together. We developed within an Agile/Scrum environment with participation from Conchango, Boots, IBM & Microsoft. The project was interesting & unique in that it was one of the first in the UK to implement the .Net 2 framework at its level of complexity with an SQL 2005/ADO.Net back-end. This was a highly skilled team made up entirely of senior developers who are leaders in their respective fields. Strong focus was placed on thorough implementation of best practices & continuous integration using Agile, Continuous Integration & Team System."
