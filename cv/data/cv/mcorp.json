    "brief": [
      "This contract position was for a prestigious .Net development house in Hampshire. I worked with the company's Continuity application framework & content management system. My responsibilities included creating bespoke software solutions for clients like Motorola, Dean & Dyball & the RNLI. Our principle technologies were ASP.Net & C# on the .Net 1.1 Framework & one of my more interesting projects involved porting the existing Continuity code-base to run on the Linux & Mac Mono .Net framework. I also made extensive use of the ITextSharp libraries to dynamically generate complex PDF documentation. We also made extensive use of Trac & Subversion for Source Control. As Continuity delivers pure XML content, much of my work entailed development of the XSL transformations to XHTML."
