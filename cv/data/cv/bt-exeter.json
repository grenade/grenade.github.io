    "brief": [
      "My position at BT was a contract developing for the 'FastPeter' project. I developed & supported transaction based messaging applications in C#. My team’s focus was on the enabling of simultaneous provision of PSTN & ADSL for UK customers. We facilitated the provision of broadband to BT customers as well as our wholesale client’s customers & those on the unbundled exchanges (basically, all broadband in the UK). We employed Continuous Integration, Test Driven Development & Agile Methodologies in an Extreme Programming environment utilising MS Build, Nant, NUnit & Version One.",
      "As an Agile development team we developed in fortnightly iterations which allowed us to focus our efforts on priority business requirements & respond quickly to change & implementation requests. I was responsible for the migration of C++ & VB.Net code to C#. This involved a great deal of refactoring & because we ran a Test Driven environment I wrote a great deal of NUnit test code in C# to ensure that the migration & refactoring resulted in stable, bug free code that met requirements. We also formalised our enterprise integration patterns through the use of a Pipes & Filters approach to message handling."
