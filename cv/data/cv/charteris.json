    "brief": [
      "At Charteris I filled the roles of technical architect, team leader & senior developer on the Associates program. I was responsible for solution design & technical architecture for a number of eCommerce & integration systems & I advocated industry best practices in numerous technical implementations for our clients. I played a key role in the restructuring of the Game.co.uk & GameStation.co.uk brands, ASP.Net websites & the ASP.Net/WCF-based, White-Label platform. The platform included numerous WCF services that enable the disparate warehousing, stock control, content & catalogue management systems of the various companies acquired by Game Group, to communicate & share information, facilitating a uniform offering across all brands. In 2007, I led a team of 6 developers in the development of a new eCommerce platform & Web UI for Game’s Checkout & Order fulfilment applications. In 2008, I worked in Costa Rica, managing Charteris’ off-shore operation where I recruited & managed a development team of 12 & a testing team of 5. I coordinated budget, logistics & project management of our overseas work & was responsible for full project lifecycle including liasing with our clients, partners & suppliers."
