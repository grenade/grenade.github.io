      "My focus at Centrax was on the development of the stock requirements, forecasting & management system. The project encompassed the integration of Business Objects, Crystal Reports & bespoke PHP4, PHP5 & Perl web applications with an AS400 DB2 ODBC back-end. I was the lead developer & managed a small team of IT personnel. I had responsibility for the technical architecture & design of a number of business applications focussed around ERP. The role involved a significant use of complex SQL, VB6, Object Oriented PHP & C++. As a manufacturing company we worked to customer & business requirements which required a great deal of flexibility & a `roll up your sleeves` approach to problem solving & customer satisfaction."
