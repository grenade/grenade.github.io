    "brief": [
      "I designed & implemented an advanced tuberculosis surveillance & reporting solution at the Centre for Infections. The application monitors disease outbreaks & patient care throughout the United Kingdom. My remit included the system design & architecture as well as developing the infrastructure for builds, releases & testing. I was also involved with negotiations with customers & users around both technical & user requirements as well as analysis & project planning. We delivered reporting software depicting geographical analysis of disease trends utilising GIS & mapping controls. The solution architecture was centred on SQL Server 2005 with dynamic SQL Reporting Services, .Net 2.0 (C#), MS Build, Atlas (Ajax), Web Services & took advantage of the rad / telerik libraries. The user interface contained many web 2.0 features while the middle tier was supported by a WSE solution that provided interfaces to the various regional authority databases & reporting systems using ADO.Net to connect to its own SQL Server data-store. I was involved with implementing patterns & practices for other projects & promoting Agile methodologies within the development departments."
